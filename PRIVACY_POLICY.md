### D. Business Transfers
If we undergo a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset transfer, data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable law.

## 7. International Data Transfers
Because our infrastructure providers may process data in multiple regions, your information may be transferred to or processed in jurisdictions outside your location. We take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate safeguards for such transfers.

When data is no longer needed, we delete or de-identify it where reasonably practicable.

Subject to applicable law, you may have rights to:
- Access personal data we hold about you
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete information
- Request deletion or restriction in certain circumstances
- Object to certain processing
