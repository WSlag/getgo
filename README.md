## 📌 Overview
GETGO PH is a Philippine trucking backload marketplace that connects shippers with cargo to truckers with available space.

It is designed as a two-way digital marketplace where:
- Shippers can post cargo requirements
- Truckers can post available trucks and routes
- Both sides can connect through a structured, platform-based workflow

---

## 🏢 Business Context
GETGO PH is designed for the Philippine market, where logistics coordination is often manual, fragmented, and inefficient.

The platform focuses on:
- Connecting cargo owners with truckers
- Improving truck utilization through backload matching
- Digitizing traditional logistics workflows
- Creating a more transparent marketplace

This project reflects real-world business logic and production-ready system design.

---

## 💡 Problem Solved
Traditional trucking coordination relies on:
- Calls, SMS, and chat apps
- Manual negotiation
- No centralized system

This leads to:
- Low visibility of trucks
- Empty return trips
- Slow coordination
- Limited trust

👉 GETGO PH solves this through a centralized marketplace with structured workflows.
